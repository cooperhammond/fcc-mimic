# wire-mafia
> :dollar: Block select applications from the wifi. Like the mafia.

Currently only working for Linux (possibly OS X), this utility blocks network connections in the specified process or command.

## Demo

## Install & Usage
The install is pretty simple, and the only dependency is [`draftlog`](https://github.com/kepoorhampond/python-draftlog).
```
$ pip install wire-mafia
```
Currently to use it, you can just run `mafia` in your terminal. I plan to add some direct flags so that you don't have to use the CLI.

## Why?
Originally created because you can't log into the same steam account on multiple computers, so I figured out that you can just turn off your wifi to do it. From there, I still wanted to play pandora and look stuff up, so I made this.
